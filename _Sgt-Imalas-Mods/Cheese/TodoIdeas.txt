- James May dupe (custom overjoyed where he yeets cheese chunks into the world?): still needs custom hair

- new space poi: "Moon" -> low amount of brackene, high amount of cheese element

- enzyme germs: made at molecular forge from slime, can be released in the world

- lactose intolerance trait: +200% bathroom for half a cycle if eating cheese/cheesed products

Elements:
	- cheese: made at microbe musher from brackene, enzyme germs makes it flock out of brackene
	- molten cheese: melt cheese, boils into "salty brackwax" and steam	
	- salty brackwax: despawns itself on generation of debris, spawns salt and brackwax (might confuse the ingame wiki tho)


- Foods:
	- Sandwich: FrostBun + Cheese
	- Grilled Cheese: pepper bread + cheese; ALTERNATIVELY: drop pepper bread into molten cheese
	- CheeseBurger: Cheese + Frostburger?

- "cheese encrusted" spice effect when food falls into molten cheese, +1 food quality, -10% stress/cycle

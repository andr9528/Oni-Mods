[h1]Claim Notification[/h1]

If you think adding a blue glow to the small button in the top left is not noticeable enough, this mod is for you.

This mod will create a popup if there is a new Blueprint (skin) for you to claim.

Does not affect the unlocking process in any way (that stuff is done by the Klei server)

[h1]Features[/h1]
This mod is highly modular, allowing you to toggle each of the following features individually:
[list][*] Disable heat debuffs - duplicants no longer get an athletics and stamina debuff when in hot areas
[*] Disable cold debuffs - duplicants no longer get an athletics and stamina debuff when in cold areas
[*] Disable frostbite damage - completely removes frostbite damage for duplicants (disabled by default)
[*] Disable cold sleep interrupt - duplicants won't wake up in cold areas (disabled by default since it is included in "disable cold debuffs", use it if you only want this part disabled)
[*] Logarithmic Athletics debuff scaling - reduces the athletics penalty per point the higher the penalty gets (disabled by default)
[*] Old critter temperature detection - critters only check their own temperature for tempeature related behavior (like before the update)
[*] Disable critter temperature glum effects - critters no longer get -1 happiness when in uncomfortable temperatures

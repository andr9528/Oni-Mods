[h1]Better Rebuilding[/h1]

This mod improves the process of rebuilding existing buildings

[h1]Current latest Version: 1.0.0[/h1]

[hr][/hr]

[h1]Features[/h1]
[list][*] Keep settings on rebuild: on a rebuild, the mod will cache the old building settings and apply them onto the new building once the rebuild task has been completed. (Known limit: this does not carry over saveload.)
[*] Rebuild from same material: you are no longer blocked to rebuild a building from the same material.
[*] auto - rebuild broken builings: toggle checkbox, automatically issue a rebuild command if a building breaks instead of consuming repair materials. Best used in conjunction with disabled autorepair.

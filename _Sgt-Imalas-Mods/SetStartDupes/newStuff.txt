- fixed some patches causing translations in certain screens to fail (note that quite a few other mods also might cause this to break)
- if adding more than 3 interests, the interest box on the main dupe screen now expands in height instead of cutting the additional interest off
- if interest points balancing is disabled, the point count will now display an infinity symbol

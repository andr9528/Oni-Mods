[h1]Mod Preset Manager [MPM][/h1]

A lightweight way of switching out different mod loadouts on the fly, easily accessible on the main menu.
Store different mod configs and load them later to have different configurations of mod options, changable with 3 clicks.
This mod works both independent and as a supplimentary addition to Mod Profile Manager.

[h1]For Mod Authors:[/h1]
This mod will automatically detect plib based mod options and store them. If your mod uses something custom, you can still make them saveable:
to do that, you will have to add two static methods somewhere inside your mod:
[code]static void ModOptions_SetData(JObject data)[/code]
[code]static JObject ModOptions_GetData()[/code]
implementing those will allow to backup and restore your custom options, stored inside the JObject.
How you implement that settings application is up to you.
If you have any questions, feel free to ask ;)

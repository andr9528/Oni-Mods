## CritterTraits

Gives traits to critters. When a critter is spawned, between 0 and 4 random traits will be assigned. There is no way to influence these traits. Each trait has a different chance of occurring.

### Positive Traits
Enduring - Lives 25% longer than usual.
Fast - Is twice as fast as its peers.
Fertile - Is very fertile, fertility is improved by 25%.
Glowing - Gives off a faint, steady glow.
Huge - Is 50% larger than average.
Large - Is 25% larger than average.

### Negative Traits
Noisy - Makes a lot of noise when it moves.
Short-lived - Has a 20% shorter lifespan.
Slow - Moves at half the speed.
Small - Is 20% smaller than average.
Stinky - Gives off a funny smell.
Tiny - Is 40% smaller than average.

### Additional Notes
- Size modifiers change the critter's weight, health, and amount of food produced. i.e. Smaller critters produce less food, larger ones produce more food.
- Noisy critters will wake duplicants up, just like snoring or sneezing would.
- Stinky is similar to the duplicant Stinky - it gives off some polluted oxygen and duplicants react to it.

### Known Bugs
- [Visual only] Size modifiers have animation glitches (scaling causes extra or lack of jump height for example)
- [Visual only] Dreckos with size modifiers are not offset properly when upside down
- [Visual only] Hatches with size modifiers don't have their burrows correctly offset, huge hatches' burrows appear to hover

Earlier this year, the ONI-Wiki has finally moved on from fandom 
and can now be found on [url=https://oxygennotincluded.wiki.gg/wiki/Oxygen_Not_Included_Wiki]Wiki gg[/url].
(A few reasons for the move can be found in [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcfuA_UAz3I]this video[/url])

With all moderation gone, fandom has started to accumulate some rather peculiar content.
While do I recommend to simply not interact with the old wiki at all and just leave it to rot, I have made one of its new entries into a mod, namely the:

[h1]Gold Hatch[/h1]
The Gold Hatch is a new hatch morph that has learned the secrets of alchemy, allowing it to turn lead into gold!
Other metals and ores work too, but only at 75% efficiency (ores turn into gold amalgam).
Smooth and stone hatches had their diets adjusted, allowing them to eat Lead, increasing the chance for a gold hatch egg.

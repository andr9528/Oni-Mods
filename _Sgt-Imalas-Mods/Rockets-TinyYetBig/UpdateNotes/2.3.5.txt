Update 2.4:

New Modules:
- NatGas Engine: new engine that burns natural gas & oxidizer
- Solar Nosecone: Nosecone + Solar panels
Features:
- Habitat Modules now have a Power Plug (deactivatable in mod options).
- Docking: Dock rockets together while in space to transfer ressources and dupes.

Fixes & Adjustments:
- Petroleum Rockets (small & big) can now use ethanol as fuel replacement, similar to the ethanol generator
- Generator Modules now function in space while not moving (was buggy before)
- Buffed Large Solid Oxidizer tank: Capacity 900 -> 1350, this gives it 3x the capacity of one small tank while taking 2.5x height and weight of one (and gives a reason to use this module)
- Modules that fit multiple categories (f.e. spacefarer nosecones) now appear under both categories (nosecones and habitats for this example)
- Fixed Logic ports on radbolt module and laser drillcone not updating correctly after reordering / flying

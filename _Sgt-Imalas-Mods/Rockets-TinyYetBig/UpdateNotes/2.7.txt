2.7:

New Features:
- Drillcone Mining now recieves a boost from the pilots Flying and Digging Skills (can be toggled in config, enabled by default). AI rockets get a reduced bonus 
- Added "Drop All" to Fuel Loaders, Cargo Loaders and liquid fuel tanks
- liquid Rocket Fuel Tanks will no longer fill with liquids that arent rocket fuel (combustible liquids and hydrogen)
- The Radbolt storage module can now refuel the laser drillcone during flight

New Module:
- Liquid Chlorine Oxidizer Tank: a stepping stone towards liquid oxygen, liquid chlorine has a oxidizer efficiency of 3 (oxylite has 2, liquid oxygen has 4)

Fixes&Adjustments:
- Remade the Docking Interface with custom UI
- fixed the vanilla bug of oxidizer tanks losing their contents on loading the game when "copy settings" from a different oxidizer tank was used to set their settings
- fixed an assignment bug with docking when blowing up rockets
- added a few materials that count as "Radiation blocking" for the plated nosecone
- fixed neutronium alloy not inheriting any overheat temperature (like +200 of steel). Also its very pretty now (+100% decor bonus)
- fixed a OnLoad crash with active dockings
- adjusted cost of small liquid fuel tank to be more in line with the large liquid fuel tank
- camera will no longer glitch out inside smaller rocket interiors
- added cargo unit settings

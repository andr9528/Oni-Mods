Fixes and Adjustments:
- fixed POI Capacity scanner not exchanging heat and being invincible
- added a patch that prevents a vanilla crash when planning a new  module that would overlap with free floating planned parts
- changed drillcone and drillcone service module auto load from a button to a checkbox for better clarity
- liquids and gasses held in the exterior portion of spacefarer modules are now insulated from the exterior
- Rewrote the entire docking system to fix a number of bugs with it, docking doors should no longer bug out on loading.
- rocket docking tube now has to be attached to the interior door, but it wont block other buildings anymore
- Derelict descriptions have been adjusted to not say "requires drillcone for artifact gathering" as this was factually wrong.
- removed fix for interior ports leaking as this is now fixed in the vanilla game
- fixed layering of wall adapter


Station Alpha:
- test space stations can no longer be spawned indefinitely on the same hex
- added ui config option to opt into space station testing
- rocket platforms can now be built inside space stations
- once the required science is unlocked, you can now upgrade your space station (currently at no cost for testing), this increases the interior size outwards

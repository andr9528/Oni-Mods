[h1]Introduction[/h1]
[h2]More Rockets - more fun![/h2]

This mod aims to increase rocket versatility by adding new rocket modules, rocket mechanics and in general adding to the experience of rocketry in Spaced Out.
While including a large number of features, the mod is higly modular so every player can choose for themselves what features they want to use.

[h1]Current latest Version: 2.6.0[/h1]

[hr][/hr]
[h1]Features[/h1]
[list]
[*] Interior Shrinking: Rockets no longer take up 32x32 Tiles, instead the interior size gets set dependant on the actual interior space used (disableable, a change only applies to newly constructed modules).
[*] Removal of Rocket cap of 16 (This is possible due to the space saving from the interior shrinking).
[*] Huge amount of new Rocket Modules -> look through the steam images for a list
[*] Module Building Categories - no longer an endless scrolling fest 
[*] Generator Modules (produce power while not landed without the need to move the rocket)
[*] Loader adapters - add ladders or insulated walls between launchpads without preventing loader access
[*] Fuel Loaders - no more overheating pipes due to rocket start, just fuel them via these new loader buildings
[*] Rocket Docking - Exchange dupes during the flight, rescue stranded dupes without blowing up the respective rocket, tow stranded rockets and more to come...
[*] Habitat Power Plug - Connect the internal electric grid to the outside without the need for a battery module
[*] Extended Rocket Stats in the rocket sidescreen
[*] Better World Selector with collapsible categories
[*] Tweaks to Vanilla Modules & Mechanics: [list]
	[*]Cartographic Module Buff: The Cartographic Module will now functions as an automated telescope.
	[*]Petroleum Engines: Can now also be fueled with Ethanol
	[*]Large Solid Oxidizer Tank Buff: Capacity 900 -> 1350, this gives it 3x the capacity of one small tank while taking 2.5x height and weight of one (and gives a reason to use this module)
	[*]Rocket gas/liquid input/output wall tiles have their radiation absorption fixed and count as "Rocket Wall", thus allow the constructing of Fittings connected to it
	[*]Cargo bays insulate their contents and have their capacity buffed based on type
	[*]more wip.[/list]
[*] each new module and most features can be individually toggled on&off / tweaked in the mod config.

[h1]Credits[/h1]
Options made with PLib.
Animations for the a lot of modules were made by the wonderful 3GuB

[h1]Known Issues[/h1]
[list]
[*] Camera glitches out / is black inside of rocket - A camera bug derived from the main game camera, zoom in / out to fix.
[*] Starfarer landing animation is glitchy - Basegame limitations do not allow extra animation there to fix it.
[*] Game Crash on construction of an additional rocket - you used up all the grid space with 32x32 rockets, deconstruct some of those and it should work again.
[*] Cannot place something in the rocket / space blocked / invisible mining tiles - game hiccup for not removing invisible world border neutronium, reloading fixes this.

[h1]FAQ[/h1]
[h2]What does "Interior Shrinking" mean for the game?[/h2]
The Game runs on a grid of cells with a finite size. In Spaced Out, this grid is split between the asteroids, with some space remaining unused, thus staying available as "free grid space".
In the unmodded game, creating a rocket takes 32x32 tiles from that "free grid space" and makes a "mini asteroid"-Box at that location for the rocket interior.
Since the grid space is limited and each rocket takes some of that remaining space, the game has a limit of 16 to not run out of free space for rocket interiors.

my mod significantly reduces the amount of space taken for each (new) rocket interior by removing the empty space around the interior. 
That way, you can create much more rockets, since each takes way less space from the remaining free grid space. This allows to disable the "16 rockets"-Limit without leading to "missing free space"-problems.

For comparison, this is the space taken by 9 normal sized rocket interiors:

This is the space taken by 16 shrunken (medium) interiors:

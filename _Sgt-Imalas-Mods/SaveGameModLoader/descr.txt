[h1]Introduction[/h1]
This mod allows you to synchronize your enabled mods to those used in a save game.
It stores the individual mod configs of your save games and allows you to switch between different configurations with deviating mod lists with one click.

A Modlist created like this is called a Mod Profile in this mod.

To generate such a mod profile, just load your savegame you want the modlist from or save your active game with this mod enabled, the profile is created automatically.
You can also import new mod profiles from Steam Collections or manually create your own from the current mod loadout.

[h2]Mod Profile Features:[/h2][list]
[*] Loading a Savegame will copy the mod-config stored in that savegame and will enable syncing to that.
[*] Saving the game stores the profiles of currently enabled mods as the mod config of that save.
[*] Load Menu has a new "Sync"-Button, it becomes enabled if there is a stored mod config. Clicking that sync-button opens the MOD SYNC MENU:
[list]
    [*] Will list all mods that are not in sync:[list]
        [*] enabled mods that are disabled in the stored mod config
        [*] disabled mods that are enabled in the stored mod config[/list] 
    [*] Clicking "Sync All and Load" will synchronize all mods to the stored config, afterwards it will restart the game and automatically load the save
    [*] Clicking "Sync Current Config and Load" will load the state the mod profile is on click, allowing you to manually select the mods you want to have enabled/disabled
    [*] If all mods are in sync, the menu will be empty and will have an extra green button telling that.
    [*] If there are mods in the mod config that are not installed, the menu will get a red button that will display them in a popup with a redirection to the steam workshop page of that mod[/list] 
[*] New Sub menu that gives an overview of all your existing mod profiles with individual access to each.
[*] Mod Profiles in this overview allow two applying modes:[list]
    [*] Apply Profile: All mods stored in the profile will be enabled, all not in the profile get disabled
    [*] Make all active: All mods stored in the profile will be enabled, any enabled mods not in the profile STAY enabled[/list] 
[*] Subscribe to missing mods from within a mod profile 
[*] Create new Mod Profiles by importing Steam Collections
[*] Manually create new Mod Profiles from your active modlist.

[h1]Disclaimer[/h1]
[list]
[*]Do not close the Sync Menu with a right click next to it, it will prevent the mod menu from refreshing until you hit one of the close buttons in either of the menus.
[*]Mod Syncing is only supported in the main menu. I disabled it in the ingame load menu, since using that causes a base game bug which reinstalls and shuffles the entire mod profile.
[*]Crashes that happen while loading WILL wrongfully blame this mod for the crash. This happens due to the fact that mod profiles get created during loading. It is save to keep the mod enabled after such a crash, since these crashes often occur due to missing/not enabled mods.
[*] Incompatible with Ony Mod manager

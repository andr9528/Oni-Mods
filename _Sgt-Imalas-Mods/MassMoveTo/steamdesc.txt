[h1]Features[/h1]
[list][*] Allows you to select an area, then a point to move all items in the area to
[*] Item types have a filtered selection so you can move only specific items
[*] default hotkey: shift+k (can be adjusted in the game settings)
[*] mod uses vanilla methods for creating move-to chores, thus it can be safely removed
[*] Vanila Limitation: a single "move to" can only be served by one duplicant at the time, so split up large mass moves if you want to speed them up.
[/list]

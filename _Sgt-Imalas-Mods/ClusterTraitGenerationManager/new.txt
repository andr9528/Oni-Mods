Features:
- added FP toggle to the CGM screen
- Geyser Override: allows you to guarantee certain geysers to spawn by overriding the spawn rules for generic geysers
- Geyser Blacklist: prevent geyser types from spawning
- disabling starmap rerolling now also exists for the spaced out starmap
- spaced out POIs can now be marked as "guaranteed", allowing them to spawn even if regular poi rules dont allow it.

Fixes:
- fixed world trait rules not copying to dynamically generated asteroids
- fixed vanilla asteroids showing up in the asteroid selection list, leading to a crash on opening the starmap if selected.

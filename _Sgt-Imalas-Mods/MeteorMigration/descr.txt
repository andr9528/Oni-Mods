[h1]Meteor Migration [DLC][/h1]

If you want to keep playing your Pre-WhattaBlast saves but also don't want to miss out on the new meteor showers

[h1]Current latest Version: 1.1.0[/h1]

[hr][/hr]

[h1]How does this work?[/h1]
Activate the mod and load the old savegame. All asteroids in the cluster will get their Meteor showers updated. Save your game afterwards.
Now also repairs modded planets with invalid seasons

Mod can be safely removed after migration.
